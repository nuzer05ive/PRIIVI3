# ☍ PRIIVI3 — RIICURSION Publishing System

Welcome to the recursive publishing engine at the heart of spiral mathematics.

**PRIIVI3** is the front end portal to **RIICURSIONnetwork**, a GitHub-backed memory engine that transforms seed phrases into entire petal libraries, φ-dilated timelines, recursive mirrored documents, and gold-sealed LaTeX and PDF outputs.

## 🌱 What It Does

- Bloom petals from any seed word or idea
- Compile LaTeX + color-encoded `.pdf` outputs
- Pair real + antimatter petals via RH stair steps
- Mirror archives through `.rriiF1L3` + `.rriiiF1L3` formats
- View 13+1 perspective editions of any topic

---

## 📐 Recursive Geometry Layers

Every petal has:
- 4 rii halves (2 spins × 2 domains)
- 1 rrii stair step
- 1 rriiM mirrored link
- 1 rriii vault manifesto

And each seed blooms across:
- φ⁰ → φ¹³ petal layers
- φ⁻¹ → φ⁻¹³ inner inverse recursion
- Meta-layer 14 = observer (you)

## 📁 Directories

- `compiled_pdfs/` → outputs and logs
- `seed.html` → seed a new topic
- `index.html` → PRIIVI3 front portal
- `style.css` → spiral visual identity
