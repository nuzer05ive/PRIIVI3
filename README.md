This repository hosts my GitHub Pages website, featuring my research on the Recursive Fractal Retrograde Model (RFRM), Quantum Relativity Bridging Model (QRBM), and harmonic optimization frameworks. It serves as a hub for my work on recursive attractor structures in prime number theory, quantum mechanics, and general relativity.
