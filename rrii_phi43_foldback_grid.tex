\begin{abstract}
This document formalizes the Omnivision Foldback Grid---a $\phi$-layered recursive projection system that enables an observer to access and synchronize with all $\phi$-dilated memory layers simultaneously. By mapping the fold structure from the \emph{Now Dot} (the base state) up to the $\phi^{43}$ layer, light is reinterpreted as navigable geometry. Orthographic rotations and Ophalum face activations (projection, reflection, integration, and folding) enable full recursive awareness via mirrored sightlines. We develop a rigorous operator framework that captures the harmonic and combinatorial structure underlying this recursive light vision.

\section{The Recursive Spiral and the Now Dot}

\begin{definition}[Now Dot]
The \emph{Now Dot} is the observer's origin, denoted by 
\[
\mathcal{N}_0,
\]
which corresponds to the undilated state (i.e. $\phi^0=1$). It serves as the initial condition for the recursive dilation process.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Phi-Dilation Operator]
Let $\phi$ be the golden ratio, 
\[
\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
Define the \emph{phi-dilation operator} $\mathcal{D}_\phi$ acting on a state vector $x$ by
\[
\mathcal{D}_\phi(x) = \phi \cdot x.
\]
Thus, for any nonnegative integer $n$, the state after $n$ dilations is
\[
\phi^n = \underbrace{\mathcal{D}_\phi \circ \mathcal{D}_\phi \circ \cdots \circ \mathcal{D}_\phi}_{n\text{ times}}(1).
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Phi-Layered Spiral Memory]
The \emph{spiral state stack} is defined as the direct sum of phi-dilated layers:
\[
\mathcal{S} = \bigoplus_{n=0}^{43} \phi^n.
\]
Each layer $\phi^n$ acts as a window into a distinct harmonic memory stratum.
\end{definition}

\section{The Foldback Grid and Its Operators}

\begin{definition}[Foldback Grid]
The \emph{Foldback Grid} is a projected tiling of the $\phi$-layers arranged in a rhombic pattern. Each window in the grid is defined by a triple:
\[
W_n = \left( \phi^n,\, \theta'_n,\, \mathcal{O}_n \right),
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\phi^n$ is the dilation scale at level $n$.
  \item $\theta'_n \in [0,2\pi)$ is the \emph{prime phase offset} (or wobble) at level $n$.
  \item $\mathcal{O}_n$ denotes the orientation induced by the \emph{Ophalum face activation} (see Section~\ref{sec:ophalum}).
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Grid Alignment Access]
Let $W_n = \left( \phi^n,\, \theta'_n,\, \mathcal{O}_n \right)$ be a window in the Foldback Grid. Then an observer can activate $W_n$ via an orthographic fold given by the operator
\[
\mathcal{F}: (\phi^n, \mathcal{O}_n) \mapsto \text{Perceived Light}.
\]
That is,
\[
\text{Access}(W_n) = \mathcal{F}\left( \phi^n, \mathcal{O}_n \right).
\]
\end{proposition}

\section{The Ophalum Face and Recursive Projections}
\label{sec:ophalum}

\begin{definition}[Ophalum Face Operators]
Define four Ophalum face operators acting on the state space:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{O}_\uparrow &:\ \text{Projection (Forward)};\\[1mm]
\mathcal{O}_\rightarrow &:\ \text{Reflection (Observation)};\\[1mm]
\mathcal{O}_\downarrow &:\ \text{Integration (Memory)};\\[1mm]
\mathcal{O}_\leftarrow &:\ \text{Fold (Silence)}.
\end{align*}
Each $\mathcal{O}_n$ in the Foldback Grid is an instance of one of these operators determined by the orthographic rotational configuration.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cyclic Face Activation]
In each orthographic cycle, exactly three faces are activated and one is held dormant:
\[
\text{Cycle}(n) = \{ \mathcal{O}_i,\, \mathcal{O}_j,\, \mathcal{O}_k \} \quad \text{with} \quad \mathcal{O}_m \,\text{off},
\]
where $\{i,j,k,m\} = \{\uparrow,\rightarrow,\downarrow,\leftarrow\}$.
\end{definition}

\section{Omnivision Dynamics and Recursive Pathways}

\begin{definition}[Recursive Camera Path]
The observer’s visual path is generated by a controlled sequence of fold operations. Let
\[
\mathcal{T}_{90^\circ}: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2
\]
denote a rotation by $90^\circ$. Then the \emph{recursive camera path} is defined as
\[
\mathcal{C}_{\text{view}} = \sum_{k=0}^{43} \mathcal{T}_{90^\circ} \circ \mathcal{D}_\phi^k,
\]
which maps the sequential phi-dilated states into a composite observable form, thereby rendering each recursive layer visible.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}[Omnivision Frame Set]
A complete tiling of 43 window frames, each defined by $W_n = \left( \phi^n, \theta'_n, \mathcal{O}_n \right)$, yields a full non-linear access to the entire recursive memory structure. In this sense, the Foldback Grid constitutes the \emph{omnivision frame set}.
\end{corollary}

\section*{Recursive Transmission Insight}

\begin{quote}
\textit{
``Light does not simply propagate; it folds upon itself.\\
In that folding, it encodes a memory of future positions.\\
The Spiral was always illuminated --- because its symmetry was preordained.''}
\end{quote}

\section{Conclusion}

The Foldback Grid provides a rigorous mathematical framework that enables omnivision from the \emph{Now Dot} (the base state) to the highest dilated state $\phi^{43}$. The system encodes visual access not as mere transmission of light, but as a harmonic folding process where each layer is accessed via precise angular and dilative alignments. Through the integration of the phi-dilation operator, phase offsets, and Ophalum face activations, this framework articulates how recursive vision becomes a form of navigable geometry. In effect, the observer is able to read all $\phi$-dilated memory layers, turning light into a structured, recursive record of existence.
